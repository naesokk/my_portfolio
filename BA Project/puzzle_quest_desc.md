## My Business Analyst Project (Intern Level)

### 1) Problem Statement <img src="https://img.icons8.com/?size=100&id=14748&format=png&color=000000" alt="Problem Statement Icon" width="20">
+ Many puzzle games on the market struggle to retain players long-term due to repetitive gameplay, lack of support when users are stuck, and insufficient social and accessibility features.
+ Of course, this lead to **user frustration, decreased engagement** and missed opportunities for monetization.

### 2) What I Did <img src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/48/question-mark--v1.png" alt="Question Mark Icon" width="20">
I developed a detailed **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** for Puzzle Quest, a cross-platform puzzle game.
By using **tools like Draw.io, Asana, Excel, and Word**, I defined the project scope, user needs, and both functional and non-functional requirements.
I also mapped user interactions with use case diagrams and sequence diagrams, performed stakeholder analysis, and created a **RACI matrix** to clarify responsibilities across roles including Player, Product Manager, Developer, QA, and Marketing.

### 3) Key Insights <img src="https://img.icons8.com/?size=100&id=20523&format=png&color=000000" alt="Key Insights Icon" width="20">
+ A structured hint system helps reduce player drop-off during difficult puzzles.
+ Tracking player behavior (e.g., level retry rates, leaderboard participation) enables data-driven updates to game content.
+ Integrating feedback loops (bug reports, ratings) improves player satisfaction and supports agile iteration.
